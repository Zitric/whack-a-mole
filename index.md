# whack-a-mole

This is a project to make the game of whack a mole

You would need to clone the repository and run `yarn && yarn start`

We have a board of 4 X 4 holes, when the whole turn blue means there is a mole
ready to be whacked, the hole will turn yellow show the user it scored

When a hole turn red means there is a bomb, if the user whack a bomb the game
will end
